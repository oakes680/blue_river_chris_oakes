# blueriver Code Challenge - Chris Oakes

# Technology Used
  * React - creat react app
  * axios 
  * css
  * react-router-dom
  * postman
  
# Problem
  * Need to access Api, filter, sort, and display data.

# Solution
    Used axios to handle api call. Set data to state.  Passed state to each component using props.  Each component represents one zone.   Filtered and sorted the data to display it properly.

# Final Thoughts
    With more time I could have done this in a more "react way"  -  Less repeated code using the DRY principle.  Seperate Component logic into utility function.
